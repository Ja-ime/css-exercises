# Methods for Adding CSS

## Objective 

1. Practice adding CSS to an HTML file using three methods: 
    - external CSS 
    -   internal CSS 
    -   inline CSS. 
2. Practice linking style sheets 

<br>
This is all about practicing using these different methods and getting the syntax right.

---
## To do: 
1. Style each element according to the method described in the image (see image). 
2. Create a CSS file and link it in the HTML file 

<br>

__Requirements__
- Use only type selectors when adding styles via external and internal methods (hint:div {})
- Use keywords for colors (e.g. "blue" instead of using RGB or HEX values).
 
<br>

__The properties you need to add to each element are:__ 

* `div`: a red background, white text, a font size of 32px, center aligned, and bold
* `p`: a green background, white text, and a font size of 18px
* `button`: an orange background and a font size of 18px

### Self Check
- Did you use all three methods of adding CSS to an HTML file?
- Did you properly link the external CSS file in the HTML file?
- Does the `div` element have CSS added via the external method?
- Does the `p` element have CSS added via the internal method?
- Does the `button` element have CSS added via the inline method?

### Troubleshooting 
_hint: start with `index.html`_
