# Grouping Selectors

## Objective 
1. Learn to create elements that have both unique and shared styles 
2. Practice adding classes and using class selectors 

<br>

_In the last challenge, you had a single element and applied different rules (multiple classes) to it. In this challenge you will give two elements each a unique class name, then add rules for styles that both elements share as well as their own unique styles._ 

<br>

## To Do 
1. Give each element a unqiue class name 
2. Add rules and styles that both elements share (as well as their own unique styles)
3. Attribute the class elements to the HTML file. 

<br>

__Requirements__ 
Take a good look at the outcome image below to see exactly what is unique about each element, and what both elements have in common. The format of any colors is entirely up to you, we trust you'll practice using the different values! The properties you need to add to each element are:

* **The first element**: a black background and white text
* **The second element**: a yellow background
* **Both elements**: a font size of 28px and a list of fonts containing `Helvetica` and `Times New Roman`, with `sans-serif` as a fallback

### Self Check
- Does each element have a unique class name?
- Did you use the grouping selector for styles that both elements share?
- Did you make separate rules for the styles unique to each element?
